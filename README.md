# Multitasking-Aware Estimation of Work-Item Duration via Proportional Overlapping-Time Redistribution


## Overview
In event logs, activities are often executed concurrently due to resource multitasking. If such overlapping executions are ignored during analysis, the recorded activity durations may be systematically overestimated, which can bias performance metrics and downstream process analysis.

Our proposed technique estimates activity durations by proportionally redistributing overlapping execution interval durations among concurrent work items. This repository presents our research work and provides an implementation of a method for adjusting activity durations in the presence of multitasking executions. The repository contains the implementation, datasets, and experimental scripts required to reproduce the results reported in the paper.

## Repository Contents
The repository includes:

- Event logs used in the experimental study
- Scripts for preprocessing, synthetic log generation, and evaluation  
- The implementation of the proposed duration adjustment method  

---

## Data Files
The experimental evaluation is conducted using the following datasets.

#### 1. Real Event Logs
The following real-life event logs are selected for further processing:

- BPI Challenge 2012  
- BPI Challenge 2017  
- Emergency Department-ED  *(the dataset is confidential and cannot be publicly shared)*
- Production  
- Purchasing  

#### 2. Preprocessed Event Logs
These logs are derived from the real event logs by removing multitasking executions, resulting in logs that represent ground-truth (non-overlapping) activity durations.

#### 3. Synthetic Multitasking Event Logs
Synthetic event logs are generated by deliberately introducing controlled overlapping executions into the preprocessed logs. For each case study, five synthetic event logs are created with different *Multitasking Ratios (MR)*:

- MR = 0.1 (`MR_0.1`)
- MR = 0.3 (`MR_0.3`)
- MR = 0.5 (`MR_0.5`)
- MR = 0.7 (`MR_0.7`)
- MR = 0.9 (`MR_0.9`)  

Due to size constraints, this repository includes only a representative sample event log *(Purchasing)*.

## Experimental Procedure
The experimental evaluation follows three main steps.

#### Step 1: Preprocessing Real Event Logs
The real event logs are analyzed to detect multitasking executions. All overlapping executions are removed to obtain logs with non-multitasked (ground-truth) activity durations.
This step is performed using the script provided in:
- [`Step_1_Preprocessing_Real_Logs`](https://github.com/FatimaAbbas567/Activity-Duration-in-Multitasking/blob/ccdb9ec5ead9ac4c06b410becca3a4ebcd334248/experiment/Step_1_Preprocessing_Real_Logs.ipynb)

#### Step 2: Synthetic Multitasking Log Generation
The preprocessed event logs obtained in Step 1 are used to introduce controlled overlaps between work items. This process generates synthetic multitasking event logs with predefined multitasking ratios.
The corresponding script is provided in:
- [`Step_2_Synthetic_Log_Generation`](https://github.com/FatimaAbbas567/Activity-Duration-in-Multitasking/blob/ccdb9ec5ead9ac4c06b410becca3a4ebcd334248/experiment/Step_2_Synthetic_Log_Generation.ipynb)

#### Step 3: Duration Adjustment and Evaluation
In this step, the synthetic multitasking event logs are used to:
- Apply the proposed duration adjustment technique  
- Apply the method (equal-splitting) proposed by [*Estrada-Torres et al.*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.datak.2021.101897)  
- Compare both approaches against the ground-truth durations  

The evaluation is performed using the ***Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)***. The corresponding script is provided in:
- [`Step_3_Duration_Adjustment_and_Evaluation`](https://github.com/FatimaAbbas567/Activity-Duration-in-Multitasking/blob/ccdb9ec5ead9ac4c06b410becca3a4ebcd334248/experiment/Step_3_Duration_Adjustment_and_Evaluation.ipynb)

## Method Implementation
The main implementation of the proposed technique is provided in:

- [`Multitasking_Duration_Adjustment`](https://github.com/FatimaAbbas567/Activity-Duration-in-Multitasking/blob/ccdb9ec5ead9ac4c06b410becca3a4ebcd334248/method/Multitasking_Duration_Adjustment.ipynb)

All parameters and assumptions are explicitly documented in the script. The implementation can be executed by cloning the repository and running it locally.
